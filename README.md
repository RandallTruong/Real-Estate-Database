Hello, this is a bulk insert SQL Script that will create the entire database filled with tables and data in a single execution. 
There are 50 tables with the core tables having over a hundred instances or rows of data. This database was created for a real estate company
so it has information pertaining to real estate agents, clients, lease listings, rental listings, etc. There is an entity relationship diagram
that displays the relationship among all the tables. The application itself no longer runs as the cloud based database is no longer active.
